os.path.realpath() can be used to get the path of the current Python script.
os.path.realpath() method in Python is used to get the canonical path of the
specified filename by eliminating any symbolic links encountered in the path.
A special variable __file__ is passed to the realpath() method to get the path
of the Python script.

Note: __file__ is the pathname of the file from which the module was loaded if it was loaded from a file.
